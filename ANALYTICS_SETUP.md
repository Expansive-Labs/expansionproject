## Verification Steps

After deploying:

1. Visit your production site: https://www.expansionprojectmusic.com
2. Wait 30 seconds
3. Open Vercel Dashboard → Analytics
4. Verify you see:
   - Visitor count: 1 (or more)
   - Page views increasing as you navigate
   - Your geographic location
5. Navigate to different pages:
   - `/` (homepage)
   - `/blog` (blog listing)
   - `/blog/[any-post]` (individual blog post)
6. Check that page views increment for each navigation

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Appearing

**Check 1: Wait Time**
- Allow at least 30 seconds after first visit
- Refresh the Analytics dashboard

**Check 2: Component Installed**
```bash
# Verify package is installed
npm list @vercel/analytics

# Should output:
# @vercel/analytics@1.5.0
```

**Check 3: Component in Layout**
```jsx
// src/app/layout.jsx should have:
import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/react";

// In body:
<Analytics />
```

**Check 4: Browser Console**
- Open browser DevTools → Console
- Look for errors related to analytics
- Check Network tab for requests to Vercel

**Check 5: Ad Blockers**
- Temporarily disable ad blockers
- Some blockers prevent analytics tracking
- Try incognito/private browsing mode

**Check 6: Vercel Plan**
- Analytics is included in Pro plan
- Verify your plan includes Analytics

### Data Not Updating

- Analytics data updates every few seconds
- Use "Real-time" view for instant updates
- Historical data may take a few minutes to aggregate

### Incorrect Visitor Count

- Visitors are **unique** within a time period
- Multiple page views from same visitor = 1 visitor
- Private browsing creates new visitor each time
- Different devices = different visitors
